# AirBnb Sanity.io Frontend


This repository is to support my tutorial on how to build an AirBnb Clone with structured content using Sanity.io and Next.js. View the full tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/mx1dbMzd3tU) ðŸ“º

In this video I show you how to build an AirBnB Clone, as well as manage all your data visually. We are going to build a backend for the app that defines the relationships between our data thanks to Schemas and Types, and add data using Sanity Studio ( https://www.sanity.io/ )

Topics we will be touching on:
* Schemas
* Types
* Content Management Systems
* Geolocation
* Google Maps API
* Clustering Markers
* Next.js
* ServerSideProps
* Sanity SDK
* React Hooks

and much more!
