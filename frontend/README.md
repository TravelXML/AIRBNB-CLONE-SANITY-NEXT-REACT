# AirBnb Sanity.io Frontend


This repository is to support my tutorial on how to build an AirBnb Clone with structured content using Sanity.io and Next.js. 

In this video I show you how to build an AirBnB Clone, as well as manage all your data visually. We are going to build a backend for the app that defines the relationships between our data thanks to Schemas and Types, and add data using Sanity Studio ( https://www.sanity.io/ )

Topics we will be touching on:
* Schemas
* Types
* Content Management Systems
* Geolocation
* Google Maps API
* Clustering Markers
* Next.js
* ServerSideProps
* Sanity SDK
* React Hooks



If you get stuck, the Sanity community I was talking about can be found here on the Sanity Exchange (https://www.sanity.io/exchange) and the Sanity Slack Community (https://slack.sanity.io/).

The backend to my project, can be found [here](https://github.com/TravelXML/AIRBNB-CLONE-SANITY-NEXT-REACT/tree/main/backend)

Google Maps API info can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps)
